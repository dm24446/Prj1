  <h1> Project Description </h1>
    <p>
      You will write four to five paragraphs about your background as well as
      your ambitions for this class and your career at IIT and beyond. Begin by
      writing this in either simple plain text (.txt) or Markdown (.md) in your
      text-editor of choice. Be sure to make frequent, descriptive commits in
      Git as you write.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once you have finished your plain-text version, use git tag to tag it as
      plain-text. You will then create a basic structured HTML page out of your
      plain-text work (revision to your content is encouraged), styled with a
      separate, basic stylesheet in CSS that is linked to your HTML via the
      "link" tag. Commit this also to Git as you write.
